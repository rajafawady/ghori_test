15. **API Usage Tracking** - Real-time usage monitoring for SaaS billing
16. **Usage Limits** - Company-level billing controls with overage management

## Security Model

The database implements enterprise-grade security with PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS):

- **Multi-tenant isolation**: Complete data separation between companies using RLS policies
- **Role-based access control**: Admin, recruiter, and viewer roles with appropriate permissions
- **Comprehensive audit logging**: All actions tracked for compliance and security monitoring
- **API security**: Usage tracking and rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Data integrity**: Foreign key constraints and check constraints ensure data consistency

## Performance Considerations

### Optimized for Scale

- **Indexed queries**: Strategic indexes on all frequently queried columns
- **Batch processing**: Efficient handling of 500+ CVs with queue management
- **Background processing**: Non-blocking operations for large data volumes
- **Connection pooling**: Optimized database connection management
- **Query optimization**: Carefully crafted queries for multi-tenant performance

### Monitoring & Analytics

- **Real-time metrics**: Processing times, queue depths, and system performance
- **Usage analytics**: API calls, candidates processed, and billing metrics
- **Performance benchmarks**: Automated testing for query performance regression
- **Capacity planning**: Historical data for scaling decisions

## Technical Specifications

### Database Requirements

- **PostgreSQL**: Version 12 or higher

- **Batch Processing**: 500+ CVs processed in under 15 minutes
- **API Throughput**: 1000+ requests per minute per company

## SaaS Features

### Billing Integration Ready

- **Usage tracking**: Real-time monitoring of API calls and candidates processed
- **Monthly limits**: Configurable per company with automatic overage calculation
- **Billing analytics**: Historical usage data for invoicing and reporting
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in protection against API abuse

### Multi-Company Support

- **Complete isolation**: No data leakage between companies
- **Independent configuration**: Per-company settings and preferences
- **Scalable architecture**: Add new companies without system downtime
- **Role-based access**: Granular permissions within each company

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Database Setup

1. **Create and configure the database:**
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\setup_database.ps1
   ```
   *Or on Unix systems:*
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup_database.sh
   ```

2. **Run migrations and seed sample data:**
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\run_migrations.ps1
   ```
   *Or on Unix systems:*
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run_migrations.sh
   ```

3. **Run the test suite (optional):**
   ```powershell
   .\tests\run_tests.ps1
   ```
   *Or on Unix systems:*
   ```bash
   ./tests/run_tests.sh
   ```

## Migration and Seed Files

The database structure is managed through sequential migration files and corresponding seed data files:

### Migration Sequence (16 Files)

## Testing Strategy

### Comprehensive Test Coverage with pgTAP

The system includes extensive automated testing across multiple dimensions:

**Test Categories:**
- **Schema Tests**: Database structure, constraints, indexes, and data types
- **RLS Tests**: Company isolation and role-based access control validation
- **CRUD Tests**: Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for all entities
- **Function Tests**: Database functions and stored procedures validation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing (matching flow, candidate pipeline)
- **Performance Tests**: Query performance benchmarks and scalability validation
